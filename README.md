Circular Economy Models
The linear economy model—characterized by the "take-make-dispose" approach—has dominated industrial production for decades, resulting in unprecedented resource depletion and environmental degradation. Electronic waste (e-waste), generating 62 million tonnes annually globally, exemplifies this crisis, with only 22.3% formally collected and recycled. The circular economy presents a paradigm shift by establishing closed-loop systems where products, materials, and components remain in use as long as possible through repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling. This report examines three fundamental circular economy models applicable to technology sectors: Design for Longevity (DFL), Product-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Retain Product Ownership (RPO). Through analysis of real-world case studies including Apple's refurbishment programs, Philips's lighting-as-a-service offerings, and Novelis's aluminum recycling initiatives, we demonstrate that circular models generate measurable environmental and economic benefits. Our analysis reveals that extending smartphone lifespan by one year saves 2.1 million tons of CO₂ annually, modular design reduces e-waste by 50%, and urban mining from e-waste yields gold recovery rates 800 times higher than traditional ore mining. India's implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations, combined with emerging technologies like AI-driven recycling and blockchain-based supply chain transparency, positions the country as a critical player in circular economy transformation. The report concludes that successful circular economy implementation requires integrated efforts across product design, regulatory frameworks, stakeholder collaboration, and technological innovation, with significant opportunities for job creation, cost savings (averaging 25% material cost reduction), and environmental impact mitigation.
